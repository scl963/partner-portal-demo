# Partner Portal Demo Version

This is a web app I created while working at Sheprd to allow people at partner organizations, such as school administrators and coordinators of after-school activities, to access real-time data about rides to and from their facilities. It was built using TypeScript, React, and Apollo for GraphQL query and local data management. 

This is a demo version that is being shared with the permission of my former employer. The database connection and authentication scheme have been removed and mock data added in order to provide a testable version of the user interface. Additionally, most of the Apollo query components have been pulled out and some typings changed in order to simplify the demo. 

To log in, simply enter any email and password combination.

A deployed version can be found here: https://partner-portal-demo.herokuapp.com/

To run locally, clone the repo to a local directory, then run the following commands:

```
yarn
```

```
yarn start
```
